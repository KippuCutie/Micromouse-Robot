Micromouse is a small autonomous robot designed to navigate a maze and find its way to the center. 
The robot typically measures around 10 cm by 10 cm and is equipped with sensors such as infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, 
and encoders that allow it to detect walls, measure distances, and track its movement.
The robot uses an algorithm to explore the maze and create a map of the paths it has taken, and then uses this map to navigate to the center of the maze.
The algorithm can be implemented using various techniques such as flood fill, A* search, or other heuristic methods.
Micromouse competitions are popular among robotics enthusiasts and students, 
and they involve a race between several robots to find the center of the maze in the shortest possible time. 
The robots must be able to navigate the maze quickly and accurately, and the competition typically rewards both speed and efficiency.
Overall, micromouse robots are a great way to learn about robotics, programming, and navigation, 
and they offer an exciting and challenging platform for students and hobbyists to develop their skills and compete with others.
